itertools is a built-in Python module that contains ready-made tools for working with combinations, permutations, and other sequence-related operations.
itertools.permutations(string) automatically gives all possible arrangements of the letters.
itertools.permutations(string) doesn’t give strings directly.
It gives a sequence of tuples — each tuple containing one possible arrangement of the letters(p = ('y', 'u', 'p'))
The empty quotes "" mean we want to join the characters together with nothing in between.
join(p) joins each tuple (like ('a', 'b', 'c')) into a string "abc"

If p = ('y', 'u', 'p')
"".join(p)
joins them without spaces → "yup"

But if you used
" ".join(p)
joins them with spaces → "y u p"

Or
"-".join(p)
joins them with a dash → "y-u-p"
