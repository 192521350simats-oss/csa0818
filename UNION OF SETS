set1 = set(map(int, input("Enter elements of first set separated by space: ").split()))
set2 = set(map(int, input("Enter elements of second set separated by space: ").split()))
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print("\nUnion of the two sets is:", union_set)

OUTPUT
Enter elements of first set separated by space: 1 2 3 4
Enter elements of second set separated by space: 3 4 5 6

Union of the two sets is: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
